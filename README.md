# My Tailwind CSS Project

This project is based on the **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** [Webpack starter] (https://github.com/tailwindcss/webpack-starter).

```
npm install

npm start
```

Webpack will watch `/src/styles.css` and `/tailwind.js` and rebuild the stylesheet on every change, a browser will load on `localhost:8080`.
